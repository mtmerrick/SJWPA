                        More than 1 million people in the greater San Joaquin region have been exposed to unsafe drinking water for many years. Contaminants
                        range from the simple and expected, like high salinity levels and low levels of dissolved oxygen,
                        to more concerning contents such as fecal matter. Our waters are consistently contaminated with pathogens
                        like E. Coli, coliform, enterococci, and many others, with naturally occurring chemicals like VOCs,
                        nitrates, selenium, strontium, and vanadium, and with agricultural runoff that includes herbicides
                        and pesticides

                    <p class="indent">
                        This water quality issue has caused many communities to face multiple environmental health threats. Nearly all Californians
                        get clean, safe drinking water delivered to their homes. However, according to state data, turning
                        on the tap is still risky for more than 1 million people in the San Joaquin Valley, where drinking
                        water is among the most contaminated nationwide, according to government testing. Even worse, most
                        residents don’t even know it, as testing of private wells is not required and most water agencies
                        fail to provide customers with required water quality reports, or provide them in a language they
                        can’t read.
                    </p>

                    <p class="indent">
                        Most affected are small, rural communities, which are disproportionately poor and Latino. Long-term fixes are in the works
                        but many solutions will take years to implement – not enough funding is available for the people
                        who need help immediately. The majority of residents in the San Joaquin Valley rely on groundwater
                        for some or all of their drinking water, and the primary California groundwater basin, the Central
                        Valley Aquifer, is deeply contaminated with a mix of man made and naturally occurring contaminants.
                        The human-caused ones include nitrates, herbicides, and pesticides, which can persist in the environment
                        long after first introduced. Naturally occurring contaminants can be just as worrisome, including
                        things like arsenic and uranium.

                    <p class="indent">
                        Most water suppliers can bring groundwater up to health standards by treating it or blending it with water from cleaner sources.
                        However, many communities get 100% of their water directly from the contaminated aquifer, and can’t
                        afford to treat it properly. According to reports by the State Water Resources Control Board, this
                        directly threatens public health. In Tulare County, for instance, contaminated groundwater is the
                        source of drinking water for 99 percent of the population. Much of this contamination is tied into
                        the use of the land and the history of its development.

                        San Joaquin County has an extensive network of riverways, streams, creeks and canals. Contrary to what it might seem however,
                        very few of these are even based on natural waterways at all. Instead, most of them were created
                        in the earlier part of the 20th century, to aid in agricultural irrigation. Additionally, most of
                        the wetlands, marshes, and other bodies of water in the San Joaquin Valley were also man-made, mostly
                        to serve as runoff collection and overflow for the waterway system. In what was considered at the
                        time to be a stroke of brilliance, many of these were also set as dual-purpose reserves for native
                        animals and migratory birds. All this is not to say the region is without natural water sources however
                        - as mentioned previously, the San Joaquin Valley sits atop the Central Valley Aquifer, one of the
                        largest in California. Starting before it was even properly discovered, this aquifer was used as
                        a water source for smaller towns, and to a far bigger extent, as the primary water source for all
                        agriculture done in the San Joaquin Valley.
                    </p>

                    <p class="indent">
                        However, when water systems were first being created, little was actually known of the geology of the region. As it turns
                        out, many of the places where it made the most sense to naturally or artificially divert water to
                        had incredibly thin and porous land separating the aquifer from the surface. Some of the locations
                        where this is incredibly true include the natural San Luis basin, and its manmade neighbor, the Kesterson
                        reservoir, were an estimated 40% of all water at the surface trickles into the aquifer. The other
                        problem that the eager geoengineers of the early 1900s failed to realize was that the soil quality
                        of the San Joaquin valley is not particularly good for plant or animal life. It is rife with many
                        naturally occurring elements and compounds that are nearly unnoticeable in small doses, but when
                        concentrated by runoff and drainage systems that never existed before, can easily reach toxic levels.
                        Historically, the worst offender of all these is the chemical element Selenium, which can cause severe
                        birth defects, along with other symptoms of heavy metal poisoning. Also, keep in mind this is in
                        addition to many herbicides, pesticides, and other pollutants found in agricultural runoff, that
                        all drain into these artificial groundwater sources.

                        The so-called ‘Kestorson Crisis’ is less well known than other major geoengineering disasters like the Salton Sea, but its
                        effects are just as haunting. The problems were painfully apparent even several decades ago, seen
                        across the entire food chain. Populations of fish swam around deformed. Entire flocks of birds were
                        unable to successfully reproduce for years on end. Efforts have been continuously made to try to
                        clean up the region for years, but much of it is still cordoned off as restricted areas due to unsafe
                        toxicity levels. However, the toxic water still continues to leak into the aquifer, and the usage
                        of that aquifer remains “largely unregulated and unmonitored”.

                    <p class="indent">
                        While the relatively natural contaminants are a major part of the problem, agricultural runoff is just as significant a problem.
                        The runoff has long been known to contain not only pesticides and other chemical pollutants, but
                        also more fecal matter than most would consider acceptable. This will only further worsen due to
                        the growing agricultural and livestock industry in the San Joaquin Valley. This directly affects
                        the health of the environment as a whole. Many studies have shown that crop biomass decreased due
                        to high salinity and similarly with fecal contamination. Additionally, fish studies were performed
                        which proved that the contaminated waters were causing a decrease in fish diversity and allowing
                        for disease to spread quickly within the underwater ecosystem. Even if only one species is directly
                        researched or focused on, many will be affected since the environment is dependent on many pieces
                        to function - if one part struggles, the entire environment will as well. In addition, studies found
                        that livestock are less productive under poorer quality water because they were more likely to become
                        diseased or experience temporary illnesses. While it may not be as significant or immediate of a
                        worry, this will directly affect the quality of our lives as well because the livestock are used
                        for human consumption. Whether it’s cows for milking, beef, or even fertilization; the quality of
                        the land will become poorer with polluted waters. As many have noticed, this highlights the interconnectedness
                        and dependency each part of the environment has on other parts. With the poor waters circulating
                        the fields or being served to livestock, it will make continue to make its way back around, and continue
                        to haunt us.

                    <p class="indent">
                        As we have illustrated, the lack of clean water in the San Joaquin Valley should be of utmost concern, as it has had far-reaching
                        effects to both the local residents as well as the wildlife that inhabit the area. Thorough detail
                        has been presented to highlight the area’s history with water contamination and pollution, along
                        with the fallout this has caused to its inhabitants. Despite this, lesser attention has been paid
                        to investigating the water crisis from an environmental justice lens, in order to discern whether
                        race and socioeconomic status has played a role in the water quality local residents have received.
                        This has begun to reverse in recent years, however, as a handful of scientific studies have examined
                        this issue of dissecting the role of socioeconomic status on water quality one receives, specifically
                        in the San Joaquin Valley. .
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">
                        As with other issues regarding the region’s water crisis, factors are often overlapping and thus difficult to distinguish
                        which factors are responsible to the differing degrees. This is apparent from the collection of studies
                        that examine the impact of socioeconomic status and drinking water quality in the region. Nearly
                        all, if not all, of these studies have agreed to the extent that lower socioeconomic status appears
                        to a play a role in the lesser quality of drinking water that some residents of the San Joaquin Valley
                        receive. However, in determining the exact extent and strength of such correlation, variation and
                        disagreement arises. This degree of difference is best illustrated in comparing two reports on this
                        same issue. The scientific study, “Social Disparities in Nitrate-Contaminated Drinking Water in California’s
                        San Joaquin Valley,” published their findings in the Environmental Health Perspect in 2011, summarizing
                        that “Our findings suggest that in smaller water systems, [community water systems] serving larger
                        percentages of Latinos and renters receive drinking water with higher nitrate levels. This suggests
                        an environmental inequity in drinking water quality.” As illustrated, the results from this study
                        are rather straightforward in indicating a scientifically significant difference in minority community
                        drinking water systems versus other water systems, thus suggesting environmental drinking water inequality.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">
                        However, further assessment of other sources does not necessarily share the same degree in connection. A 2014 publication
                        in the Journal
                        <i>Am J Public Health</i> titled, “The drinking water disparities framework: on the origins and persistence
                        of inequities in exposure,” also conducted scientific studies on the correlation between socioeconomic
                        status and drinking water access. In analyzing their findings on the link between the two, the authors
                        write, “The framework argues, and the Toolevillecase confirms,that there is no direct causal path
                        between race and class and disproportionate burdens; rather, race and class are imbricated in almost
                        all the factors and actors that have historically combined, and still combine, to produce this composite
                        burden” (610). As opposed to the previous study which argues that the lesser qualities of water in
                        lower socioeconomic status communities is evidence of environmental inequality, this study argues
                        that the picture is more complicated. Instead, the authors argue that race and class has no direct
                        path between water quality and other disproportionalities, but rather that they may form the basis
                        of a combination of factors that result in a “composite burder” for such communities. These studies
                        and their findings, when considered as a collection, bring an important point into the San Joaquin
                        water crisis: there are not many studies done on the impact of socioeconomic status on water quality,
                        and those that do conflict to the degree on correlation. Therefore more focus needs to be placed
                        on this area of water quality studies as the Valley moves forward into the future and attempts to
                        rectify its water issues.

                    <p class="indent">
                        California has been looking for several treatment plans to the current water crisis in the San Joaquin Valley. Among many,
                        salinity management is one approach. Specifically, soil salinity, where ground water of high salt
                        concentration is used for irrigation. In order to make efficient decisions, it is highly important
                        that farmers keep track of the groundwater levels and the amount of salt in their land and water.
                        Going further, another approach to this problem is adopting a centeralized Integrated Urban Water
                        Policy (IUWP). This is a fundamental concept of water management forcing specific regions to manage
                        water more responsibly. However, these IUWP proposals have had little sucess so far.

                    <p class="indent">
                        As California continues on coming up with different approaches, the state has to consider the numerous irrigation systems
                        in the area, as well the growing population. With no clean water, farmers are unable to rely on their
                        crops to provide food for the people of San Joaquin Valley, and the rest of the country. Crops also
                        need great amounts of fertilizers to grow in this region's poor soil, and these fertilizers contain
                        nitrates that can easily get into the water system. Crops can only take in a certain amount of water,
                        salt, and even nitrates. In other words, once the crop receives the maximum amount of nitrate it
                        can hold, the excess nitrate is washed away into the drainage water and eventually gets into the
                        nearby rivers. In order to reduce excess nitrate, an approach is being developed where farmers would
                        be foreced to keep track of the amounts of nitrate-containing fertilizers used for their crops.

                        Nevertheless, there will always be many other solutions to the water crisis. However, possibly the most promising one, which
                        has has actually seen adoption and sucess is prioritizing the use of river water over contaminated
                        aquifer water. Currently, seven towns in the the city of Tulare are working on using river water
                        as a source of drinking water. In these situations, river water from snowmelt is proving to be a
                        great solution to obtaining clean drinking water. Obviously this does not solve the agricultural
                        problem, but this is a great step in the right direction. Ensuring that the entirity of the San Jouaquin
                        Valley has clean drinking water is of paramount importance, and we need to keep moving forwards toward
                        that goal while still celebrating the smaller victories we have along the way.
