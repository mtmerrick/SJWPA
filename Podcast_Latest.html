                    <p> Join us in this month's episode of Watertalkin, where our hosts Tony, Katya, Faris, and special guest
                        Matthew Merrick discuss the San Joaquin Valley’s most threatening issue. As our subscribers will
                        know, the issue is the exceptionally poor water quality found here, and ultimately the lack of access
                        to any high quality water. Many residents are living in areas that feel more like a 3rd world country
                        than what most would think of as California. This episode will cover the basics - from the issues,
                        causes, socioeconomic influence, agricultural concerns, and finally some ideas for the future.
                        <br>
                        <br> Remember, the most important thing to do is to stay informed! You don't want to be left in the dark
                        about important local issues, so stay tuned for the next episode to find out something new that could
                        be impacting your home!

                            <br>
                            <b>Faris:</b> Let's get down to business. For this episode, I think it’s imperative to discuss the
                            water crisis that’s occurring in our own backyard.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Tony:</b> That’s right Faris. We often think of water issues and drinking water contamination
                            to be a historically third world problem or one that developing countries deal with. I think
                            we tend to think issues like the Flint water crisis are rare and extreme for our country, but
                            it is a bigger, more common problem than we acknowledge.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Katya:</b> Absolutely, that’s something we’re dealing with in our local area, specifically the
                            Central Valley.
                            <br>

                            <b>Faris:</b> Right, definitely. To update our listeners on the situation we have here in the valley,
                            let’s bring out our San Joaquin Valley Historical Correspondent Matthew Merrick.

                            <b>Katya:</b>
                            Hi Matt! So, you’ve recently been specializing in researching the history of the Central Valley, and recently become a local,
                            correct?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Matthew:</b> Yes, that’s right. Thank you for having me.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Tony:</b>
                            Alright Matt, could you go ahead and give our listeners a little bit of background into the San Joaquin Valley, and the current
                            water crisis we find ourselves in.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Matthew:</b> Thanks Tony. So you guys may have noticed all the streams and canals in Merced,
                            and the rest of the Central Valley. Contrary to what you might have thought, these don’t really
                            connect to natural rivers or streams at all. Instead, they drain out to artificially created
                            drainage basins and wetlands and I think you guys been to one of these, the San Luis National
                            Refuge:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Faris:</b> Oh ya I have! It's a beautiful refuge but has rather musty waters.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Matthew:</b> And that water definitely isn’t clean - because it isn’t. See, all these canals,
                            reservoirs, and drainage sites were constructed somewhere after world war 2, and I really can't
                            fault the engineers who designed this for how things turned out - there was a lot they just didn't
                            know about the hydrology and geology of the area. For example, did you guys know that this entire
                            region sits on top of one huge aquifer? Called, not very creatively, The Central Valley Aquifer.
                            Additionally these areas actually has some really terrible soil quality, containing a lot of
                            rather unpleasant naturally occurring chemicals and compounds. The most notable of which is called
                            selenium. These are naturally stable, but the streams have been channeling it directly into certain
                            spots. The most famous one being The Kesterson Reservoir, or more well known as the Kesterson
                            Crisis.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Faris:</b> You mentioned how the soil quality is rather poor here as a result of the chemical
                            pollutants. Can you elaborate on how you see that playing on the region’s agriculture and water
                            systems?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Matthew:</b> Well yes the aquifer that I mentioned sits underneath all these water systems that
                            sits on the surface and the barrier between those is very thin. Current measurements say that
                            about 40% of all the water and contaminants that are in the surface water flow down into the
                            aquifer. That aquifer is the source of not only all of the water for the smaller cities throughout
                            the central valley but also for all 100% of the water that is used in the agriculture in the
                            central value.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Faris:</b> Thank you for elaborating, great stuff. I wish you the best in your research and keep
                            up with the good work.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Tony:</b> I think Matt left us with a lot a great information there about the impact of pollutants
                            on our water and the impact on the environment and agriculture. What are your guys thoughts on
                            that?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Faris:</b> I’m so glad you asked Tony. Most of the chemical contaminants are from agricultural
                            land run off. This is an extreme issue considering the soil’s poor quality as mentioned by Matthew
                            earlier. With this in mind, we face many agricultural and general environmental effects that
                            directly impact our water quality negatively. The Central Valley Water System is infested with
                            chemical pollutants as well as fecal matter and that is no surprise. Lots of studies, it has
                            been confirmed that crop biomass will be decreased due to this type of pollution. Studies have
                            been done on fish proving that the poorer water quality decreases biodiversity and leads to more
                            illness. While these studies were done on a limited variety of fish species and crops, it is
                            obvious that it will effect more than just those specific species. Finally, we found some studies
                            that tested how this sub-par standard of water affected livestock. As expected, it found that
                            livestock were less productive and more prone to disease. This could be a disaster for humans
                            as well because all environments are interconnected and reliant on each other.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Tony:</b> So I noticed that we’ve been discussing different types of contaminants throughout
                            thus far. Faris, can you clarify for our listeners what exactly we are referring to?.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Faris:</b> Sure! We’re talking about high salinity levels, low levels of dissolved oxygen, fecal
                            matter, micropathegens like E. Coli, coliform, enterococci, and other illness causing pathogens
                            that I can’t pronounce, potentially toxic minerals like, nitrates selenium, and vanadium, and
                            agricultural runoff that includes herbicides and pesticides.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Tony:</b> Right, and these high levels of said contaminants are what makes them unhealthy, correct?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Faris:</b> Yeah, to clarify, these contaminants are often not inherently dangerous. In small
                            quantities the human body doesn't really mind most chemicals. In fact, many minerals and compounds
                            that are toxic in large quantities are required for healthy bodily functioning. In extremely
                            high or low amounts, they can become dangerous.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Tony:</b> Another angle I wanted to look at this water crisis through its its impact on the local
                            people. Ultimately, water contamination primarily affects people and the stories of these residents
                            need to be heard. Take for example, the 72 page report from Pacific Institute, “The Human Costs
                            of Nitrate-Contaminated Drinking Water in the San Joaquin Valley.” The report opens with some
                            of the experiences that Valley residents have had to deal with as a result of lack of access
                            to clean drinking water, You mind if I share an excerpt?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Faris:</b> Please, go ahead!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Tony:</b> Alright. The report reads, “ In Seville in the heart of California’s San Joaquin Valley,
                            Becky wakes up worrying about whether she has enough bottled water to make coffee and give her
                            elderly mother a glass to take with her medications. If not, she may have to turn to the nitrate-contaminated
                            water from her tap (Los Angeles Times, 11/7/10). Nearby, in the farming town of Orosi, Sara used
                            to try not to get too thirsty during gym class because the fountains at her school were shut
                            off due to nitrates and the only alternative was to purchase a drink she could not afford. And
                            in the tiny town of Tooleville, Maria used to get a ride to buy five-gallon water jugs from a
                            nearby city to bathe her infant without risking her child ingesting water contaminated with nitrates
                            (Visalia Times, 8/4/2004). These day-to-day experiences of living with nitrate-contaminated water
                            are not uncommon in the San Joaquin Valley, especially for rural residents in small, unincorporated
                            communities.” End Quote: As you can see, we have school kids who are forced to control their
                            thirst, possibly going dehydrated, simply because they know they don't have access to water and
                            their families can’t afford to pay for water bottles. That’s not something kids should have to
                            focus about! The thing we need to consider when we talk about the water crisis is that these
                            are real people being affected by this. What do you guys think about these situations?

                            <b>Faris:</b> I think this is horrible and we need to make improvements however possible. I can’t
                            imagine having to worry about getting a cup or bottle of filtered water on a regular basis. That’s
                            insane. We’ve spent a good deal of time chronicling this severe issue in the Valley. I think
                            it's time we take a look at possible solutions to this water contamination crisis. Katya, you
                            have any ideas?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Katya:</b> Yeh sure, I have some great ideas I have researched! Lately, California has been working
                            on several treatment plans. One approach that stands out the most is salinity management. By
                            the way, quick side note, soil salinity is where groundwater of high salt concentration is used
                            for irrigation. In order to avoid excess amounts of soil, farmers should keep track of their
                            groundwater levels with the amounts of salt in their land and water. This approach may be highly
                            efficient. In general, as California continues on developing different treatment plans, it is
                            vital to keep in mind the numerous amounts of irrigation systems in California. In addition,
                            researchers must keep in mind the population is growing every day. Crops are one of the main
                            sources of food that provide nutrients for California’s people. Therefore, farmers need clean
                            water for their crops to feed the people of the San Joaquin Valley. Farmers also need fertilizers,
                            containing nitrate, for their growing crops. The problem here is that crops only need limited
                            amounts of these nitrates, so as a result copious amounts of excess nitrates are released into
                            the drainage water. Not to worry, there is a solution! Researchers have been working on an approach
                            to reduce the amounts of excess nitrate. Pretty much, farmers would keep a log of how much fertilizer
                            they use for their crops. Before I finish off, I’d like to offer one last solution. River water
                            can be a great source of drinking water. Snow melts flows down the mountain into the rivers of
                            the San Joaquin Valley. Overall, research is being done every day, and treatment plans are continuously
                            being developed.
