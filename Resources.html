                            <u>Living in California’s San Joaquin Valley May Harm Your Health</u>
                        </a>
                        <br> An editorial from the community news site
                        <i>Water Deeply</i>. This article discusses how some Californians are being forced to question if the
                        water supply avaliable today is actually clean enough for consumption. San Joaquin Valley residents
                        face some of the nation’s most contaminated water supplies yet. Worst of all, many don’t even know
                        if it the water is safe or not, until after repercussions like severe health effects. Those who are
                        the most affected are lower income Latino families. This is all due to the contamination of groundwater
                        supplies and negligence. For these families, Nitrates are one of the most problematic contaminates
                        seeping into the water system. Since the Valley is mostly agriculturally driven, we are forced to
                        seek solutions other than just reducing nitrate usage.

                            <u>Call To Action: Valley’s Contaminated Water is Like ‘Third World Country’</u>
                        </a>
                        <br> A news article from local news site
                        <i>The Fresno Bee</i> that looks into how the valley has been combating “3rd world country treatment”.
                        The San Joaquin Valley is one of the most forgotten and mistreated areas of California. Statistics
                        depict that 1 in 4 schools in the valley have been impacted by issues stemming from unsafe levels
                        of nitrates in the waters. Additionally, the residents are actually forced to pay more for water
                        than almost all other regions - in fact families in the San Joaquin Valley pay 10% of their monthly
                        budget just to clean their water. In general, residents and sympathetic officials would like to change
                        the current dynamic and mitigate these issues, but solutions are coming along far slower than anyone
                        would like.

                        <br> A comprehensive study done by the US Geological Survey and the California Groundwater Ambient Monitoring
                        and Assessment Program, starting in 2010. This research reports raw data that conclusively finds
                        that the San Joaquin Valley has some of the highest levels of waterborne dissolved solids in the
                        country. This includes potentially hazardous materials such as selenium, rhodium, stronium, and more,
                        in addition to more well-known contaminants like nitrates. Importantly, this article discusses the
                        science behind the little-known fact that many of the most problematic contaminants don't alter the
                        waters clearness. This article also explains the consequences of the natural water recharge from
                        the surface into the groundwater/aquifer. This has lead to fecal matters and other surface pollutants
                        making it into the groundwaters. Runoff from other areas like the Sierra Nevadas have also caused
                        increases in contaminants that end up in surface water reservoirs, further devaluing the potability
                        of the waters.
